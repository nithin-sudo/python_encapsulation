# Student Performance Tracking System

This is a simple Python project that tracks student performance using the concept of **encapsulation** in object-oriented programming.

## What It Does

- Stores a student's name, ID, and grades for different subjects.
- Allows adding grades (only if valid, between 0 and 100).
- Calculates the student's GPA based on the grades.
- Generates a report showing the student's details, all grades, and GPA.

## Concepts Used

- **Encapsulation**: Grades and GPA are stored privately inside the class.
- **Data validation**: Only valid grades are accepted.
- **Modularity**: All actions are done through proper methods.

## Example Output

{
'name': 'Nithin',
'student id': '111',
'grades': {'Maths': 99, 'Science': 99},
'GPA': 99.0
}
